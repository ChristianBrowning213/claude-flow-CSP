# Purpose
Track every CASCADE_CSP subsystem pattern harvested into `claude-flow-CSP`, including exact file mappings, adaptations, tests, and known limits.

# Scope
- Source snapshot: `CASCADE_CSP/`
- Destination runtime: `v3/@claude-flow/csp-runtime/`
- CLI bridge only: `v3/@claude-flow/cli/`
- Runtime docs: `docs/runtime/`
- Explicit non-goal: replacing Claude Flow orchestration.

# Harvest Index (numbered list of harvested subsystems)
1. Workspace Docker execution substrate and staging safety patterns.
2. Memory server as structured persistence service with consolidation.
3. Research ingestion/index/query substrate with citation bundles.
4. Runtime tool packaging and registry pattern.
5. Operator documentation/playbook pattern for LLM usage loops.

# NOT TAKEN
- CASCADE orchestrator core (`CASCADE_CSP/conversational_system/core/orchestrator.py` and any equivalent planner replacement).
- CASCADE Streamlit UI and conversational frontend runtime.
- Any subsystem that would supersede Claude Flow coordination ownership.
